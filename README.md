# FeelProgrammingAtHome
Help new developers feel at home while programming in any language
The whole idea of this repository is to let the programmers step out of their comfort zone and try out any language to get their idea implemented. This is quite ambitious but can be achieved given the fact that once there is a will there is a way. We can aptternize that slogan to once there is a will there is a program.
Ok Enogh of theocratic philosophy; let≈õ make it pragmatic.

I will try to begin with Java, Python, Go and add on other languages as I proceed further.

The journey will start with Hello world and I continue to build up the complexity and wiring the applications or programs together as much as possible.

So, please stay tuned.
